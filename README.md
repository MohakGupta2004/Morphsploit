## 🔥 **Morphsploit** – Web Payload Manipulation & Exploitation Framework

> *"Exploit the structure. Morph the flow."*

**Morphsploit** is a modular, offensive web application post-exploitation and automation framework designed to manipulate, mutate, and mangle web-layer vectors like HTTP methods, headers, cookies, parameters, and request flows.

Crafted for red-teamers and CTF junkies, **Morphsploit** focuses on automating real-world exploitation techniques such as:

* 🌀 **CSRF abuse with session misdirection**
* 📤 **Parameter pollution & injection (GET/POST/JSON/XML)**
* 🔄 **HTTP method tampering (e.g., GET → DELETE fuzzing)**
* 🔐 **Auth-bypass automation via token morphing & logic flaw chaining**
* 📁 **File upload misconfig fuzzing & MIME-based evasion**
* 🧬 **Payload mutation** via your own encoded, hexed, or malformed variants

Whether you’re firing off crafted exploit chains or probing for obscure misconfigurations, Morphsploit lets you **morph request structures dynamically**, simulate adversarial behavior, and build automation flows that go beyond typical scanners.

### 🧩 Core Philosophy:

* **Manual control with automation muscle**
* Designed to **complement tools like Burp, but never depend on them**
* Stealth, speed, and precision — **not bloated scans**

---

### 🚀 Future Add-ons (if you want):

* Modular scripting via Go plugins or Lua/JS
* Embedded REPL for quick testing (`morph > inject --target /api/user`)
* Web dashboard for visualizing exploit flows (optional, just for swag)
